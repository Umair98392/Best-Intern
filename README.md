# Best Intern Selection System

## Overview

The "Best Intern Selection System" project aims to streamline the process of selecting the most qualified interns for a machine learning position. By analyzing a dataset that includes various features such as academic background, technical skills, project experience, and more, we develop a system to evaluate and rank candidates based on these criteria.

This Jupyter Notebook walks through the entire process of data exploration, preprocessing, model development, and candidate ranking, providing a comprehensive solution for recruiters to efficiently identify the best candidates.

## Features

- **Data Analysis**: In-depth analysis of candidate data, including academic performance, technical skills, and project experience.
- **Candidate Ranking**: Development of a scoring system to rank candidates based on their suitability for a machine learning internship.
- **Model Development**: Use of machine learning techniques to enhance the selection process.
- **Visualization**: Visual representation of data and candidate rankings for better decision-making.

## Dataset

- **Features**: The dataset includes various attributes such as:
  - Academic Background (GPA, Degrees)
  - Technical Skills (Programming, Machine Learning, Data Science)
  - Project Experience (Number of projects, Types of projects)
  - Other relevant features

- **Format**: CSV or other data formats as used in the project
